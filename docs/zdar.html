                <h2>Z Data at REST</h2>
                <p>The ongoing costs of making low-latency copies of z/OS data for every new application that needs current operational data access are <b>HUGE</b>, not 
				to mention the layers of technical debt that can be added to your systems to be maintained forwever. 
				Some use cases may genuinely have some need for a physical copy of the mainframe data, but many use cases can be served better and cheaper by just deploying an 
				API to serve the data on demand to any application on the internet</p> 
				
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">It is true that the predominant pattern for serving new cloud applications with current operational data is to stream the data off the mainframe 
				to a digital integration hub of some sort. Many sites are so familiar with that pattern that they don't fully evaluate the merits of serving APIs 
				directly from the original data source.</p> 
												
				<p>The articles in this section contain worked examples of how to use various IBM software solutions to serve data and information APIs directly from z/OS.</p>

	<h3 align=center>IBM's Z Data at REST Options</h3>
    <p>IBM's premier solution for serving REST APIs from mainframe systems is z/OS Connect Enterprise Edition. It is designed to act as an API gateway 
	into z/OS transactions as well as z/OS data.</p> 
	<p>This sets of papers is focussed on the details of how the underlying data services are created and implemented. They also show how APIs can be published 
	(whether by z/OS Connect, or API Connect) based on those data services.</p>

            <p>CDC Replication is aimed at <b>heterogenous</b> data replication.</p>
				<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports all the regular relational databases ( Db2 Oracle, SQL Server etc... ) as sources and targets.
				<li>Additionally, it supports non-relational databases such as IMS and VSAM.
				<li>And it supports non-relational targets such as Apache Kafka (various distributions of Kafka).

            <p>Q Replication is primarily aimed at <b>homogeneous</b> DB2 Replication. (both Db2 z/OS and DB2 LUW). If your sources and targets are all Db2, 
			then Q Replication offers some attractive benefits such as:</p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports in-line DDL Replication between Db2 z/OS sources and Db2 z/OS targets..
				<li>It supports publishing to MQ in open formats, enabling a pub/sub integration model with MQ consumers.
				<li>It is the basis for the GDPS Active-Active continuous availability solution.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Q Capture Agents stream changes to Q Apply agents over Websphere MQ messaging channels. Devops management is supported with both graphical and scripting interfaces.</p>

            <p>Datagate is a <b>lightning fast</b> data replication protocol between a Db2 z/OS V12 source and a <b>Db2 Software Container</b>, such as Db2 Analytics Accelerator, or Datagate. </p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports a choice of conventional row-based Db2 targets, or columnar Db2 targets that are optimised for Analytics.
				<li>It supports acceleration of analytical SQL queries on Db2 z/OS by transparently routing them to a columnar Db2 Software Container.
				<li>It provides the ability to place your operational Db2 z/OS data in the cloud to support new cloud-native development projects.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Datagate is a much narrower use case that the more generalised CDC and Q Replication tools, because it only supports Db2 Software containers as targets. 
			But if your requirements fit within that envelope it is the best replication option by far ( lower z/OS software consumption charges, redcued cpu cycles, 
			ultra-low data latency, devops controls for changes, etc... ).</p>
