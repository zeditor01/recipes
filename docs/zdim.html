<h2>Z Data in Motion</h2>
<p>As Enterprises deploy more and more applications in the cloud, the demand for access to <b>CURRENT DATA</b> becomes ever more critical. 
Terms Like "Data Fabric" and "Data Mesh" have entered the vernacular of IT professionals to describe architectural approaches for addressing that need. 
Sidestepping the precise academic meanings and subtleties of these terms, it is safe to say that most data fabrics fall into one of two broad catageories</p>
<ul>
<li>Stream everything off the mainframe as fast as possible, and use modern, open source integration technologies to create a digital integration hub.
<li>Leave the data in situ, and provide efficient APIs to access from wherever you need it.
</ul>
<p>Candidly, the first pattern is the most common pattern being implemented today. Advocates of this approach use a wide range of arguments to justify the 
approach, including "CQRS Architecture", "Getting off the Mainframe", "Cloud Modernisation". As a mainframe advocate I often find myself arguing in favour 
of the second approach on the basis of efficiency in not moving the data, and not incurring all 
the associated costs of software, hardware, encryption, governance etc... for all the data copying.</p>
<p>Truth is that both approaches have their merits for different use cases, and the worked examples in this site show how to deploy solutions to either the  
<a href="/recipes/docs/zdim.html">Z Data in Motion</a> model or the <a href="/recipes/docs/zdar.html">Z Data at REST</a> model. We also publish a hybrid model 
which combines both models to provide a comprehensive <a href="/recipes/docs/eris.html">Environment for Realtime Information Services</a>.</p>
<p> This section covers the three primary "Z Data in Motion" options for IBM Z data sources.</p>

            <p>CDC Replication is aimed at <b>heterogenous</b> data replication.</p>
				<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports all the regular relational databases ( Db2 Oracle, SQL Server etc... ) as sources and targets.
				<li>Additionally, it supports non-relational databases such as IMS and VSAM.
				<li>And it supports non-relational targets such as Apache Kafka (various distributions of Kafka).

			<td style="vertical-align: top;"> 
            <p>Q Replication is primarily aimed at <b>homogeneous</b> DB2 Replication. (both Db2 z/OS and DB2 LUW). If your sources and targets are all Db2, 
			then Q Replication offers some attractive benefits such as:</p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports in-line DDL Replication between Db2 z/OS sources and Db2 z/OS targets..
				<li>It supports publishing to MQ in open formats, enabling a pub/sub integration model with MQ consumers.
				<li>It is the basis for the GDPS Active-Active continuous availability solution.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Q Capture Agents stream changes to Q Apply agents over Websphere MQ messaging channels. Devops management is supported with both graphical and scripting interfaces.</p>

            </td>
			<td style="vertical-align: top;"> 
            <p>Datagate is a <b>lightning fast</b> data replication protocol between a Db2 z/OS V12 source and a <b>Db2 Software Container</b>, such as Db2 Analytics Accelerator, or Datagate. </p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports a choice of conventional row-based Db2 targets, or columnar Db2 targets that are optimised for Analytics.
				<li>It supports acceleration of analytical SQL queries on Db2 z/OS by transparently routing them to a columnar Db2 Software Container.
				<li>It provides the ability to place your operational Db2 z/OS data in the cloud to support new cloud-native development projects.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Datagate is a much narrower use case that the more generalised CDC and Q Replication tools, because it only supports Db2 Software containers as targets. 
			But if your requirements fit within that envelope it is the best replication option by far ( lower z/OS software consumption charges, redcued cpu cycles, 
			ultra-low data latency, devops controls for changes, etc... ).</p>
