Recipes & Worked Examples for Getting Things Done on z/OS


Data Analysis of Mainframe Data at Rest.
- Using industry-standard tools ( Jupyter, python, graphDB, etc... )
- with a range of SQL and REST APIs
- exploiting SQL Data Insights ( AI-enabled query )
- without needing a network of "support servers" surrounding IBM Z 
- and extending query reach beyond Db2 z/OS to IMS, VSAM and other data sources on IBM Z

Z Data in Motion, if you choose to copy Z Data to other platforms
- data replication using Infosphere CDC from IMS, Db2 and VSAM to Kafka and other LUW targets
- data replication and publishing between Db2 databases
- Operations and Monitoring approaches

Machine Learning with IBM Z transaction and data systems
- Point of View: When to deploy AI patterns on Telum-enabled IBM Z, and when to use GPU-enriched Intel systems.
- Tensorflow Serving on IBM : deployment patterns
- Watson Machine Learning for z/OS : deployment patterns
