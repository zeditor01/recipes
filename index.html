       <div class="w3-left w3-padding-4">
       <p>Mainframe data is the <b>ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIAL</b> for the following critical initiatives in Enterprises (that use mainframes).</b>
       <ol>
       <li>Continuous Transaction Processing to support the Core Business</li>
       <li>Develop and Serve AI models to help automate and govern those core business transactions</li>
       <li>Deploy realtime Data APIs to serve the needs of Cloud-based systems of engagement with clients</li>
       </ol>	

       <p>The architectural challenge is to find the best way(s) to create realtime APIs ( for transactions, data access, and AI scoring ) based on the mainframe data, to support these initiatives.</p>

<h2>Right Shift ?</h2>
</div>

<img src="/images/RightShift.JPG" alt="Data Streaming" style="height:400px">

<p>A <b>Right Shift</b> Approach deploys services and APIs on other platfoms such as linux on-permise or public cloud. 
This approach requires infrastructure to stream new data from operational transaction off the mainframe as soon as it has been commited, and deliver it to "data consumers" that will 
receive and curate the data to serve APIs that are called by cloud applications. There are many software solutions to replicate data between heterogenous systems with productive administration and monitoring interfaces. 
The challenging aspects to this approach are to overcome the network, security, encryption and automation challenges of the heterogeneous environment that will typically be managed by several tens of technical teams spread across your 
own organisation and outsourced or cloud providers.</p>

<p>A <b>Left Shift</b> Approach deploys services and APIs on the mainframe itself, and avoids the expense, delays and technical debt of infrastructure to copy data to other platforms.
There are many tools and techniques to facilitate this patterm, including z/OS Connect, Db2 Rest Service Manager, Watson Machne Learning for z/OS and z/OS container extensions.</p>

       <p>These patterns will cause fierce debate between advocates of competing approaches. 
          The following personalities might argue their corners as follows...</p>

       <p>Mainframe advocates might identify the fact the platform supports and incorporates the majority of capabilities seen in Linux and Cloud platform, 
       including RESTful APIs, machine learning and AI, columnar and in-memory analytics appliaances, software containers and more. Why not take advantage of these capabilities and leverage the data in situ.</p>

       <p>Cloud advocates might identify power and flexibility of deploying and scaling workloads at the push of a provisioning button, and argue that the future of computing is on the cloud.</p>

       <p>But the truth is that different workloads have different functional and non-functional requirements, and the ideal pattern is one that allows you to deploy your workloads on whatever platform you deem to be 
       most approapriate to the business needs of that workload. The Openshift Container platform (running on Z, intel or Cloud) does just that. 
       And IBM offers some pretty awesome data integration options, including Data Gate, to facilitate the simplest, fastest means of surfacing your realtime data where it needs to be. </p>

	<p>"Zeditor" deliberately avoids the arguments over which pattern is best. 
		Each of the patterns has their merits. 
		Instead, this website is dedicated to providing practical worked examples of all three patterns. 
		The worked examples should provide some insight into each deployment pattern, so that you can judge what a deployment project might look like in your environment. 
	All the worked examples are created on an IBM Z server residing in Sydney, which has z/OS, z/VM and Openshift LPARs. A separate linux environment is used for the Right-Shift examples.</p>

<p>Neale Armstrong works for IBM Australia as a System Z Data Management Technical Specialist. Born a Pom, I had the opportunity to transfer "down under" and live in Australia. Despite being an Aussie citizen now, I confess to being conflicted during Ashes series. On weekends and holidays I can transform into a "mamil" or a "Grey Nomad" as I explore parts of this wonderful country.</p>

<p>My motivation for creating this website was to become more efficient at my job by creating re-useable content for the client projects that I get involved with. 
For example, when advising multiple clients about heterogeeous CDC deployments I found that 80% of the discussion content was common to all clients, so I decided to document worked examples that were genericly indicative for all use cases. 
It was helpful to be able to refer clients to worked examples for the majority of their questions, and then address client-specific questions directly.
</p>

<p>As the scope of my word expanded, I realised that most of my client engagements fell into one of three patterns for delivering "data products" for Enterprise clients whose core systems ran on z/OS. I found it helpful to contrast the relative merits of each pattern. 
As Openshift becomes more widely adopted, more clients are open to considering the Hybrid Cloud pattern for Mainframe Data Integration. By providing side-by-side worked examples of all three major patterns we can have a better-informed discussion about the options.</p>
	

<p>I hope that these worked examples are of practical help to you as a reader. 
If the IBM products that you read about on this site are of interest, then please contact your local IBM representative for further information. 
If you have any feedback or questions that you would like to direct to me personally, please drop me an email at neale.armstrong@au1.ibm.com using  "Zeditor Feedback" as the subject of your email.</p>
