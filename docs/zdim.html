                <h2>Z Data in Motion</h2>
                <p>In recent years there has been an explosive growth in cloud applications, often with mobile phone apps as clients, that demand 
				access to <b>current</b> data from operational datatores. Whether you are ordering a taxi, a pizza or a bank balance, the customer 
                has zero interest in the state of the data 5 minutes ago. The only kind of data that is acceptable for most apps is data that is bang up to date.</p>
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">Writing as a mainframe advocate, my instinctive reaction is to build APIs on the mainframe to serve those cloud applications directly. 
				There is plenty of great software available from IBM to build REST APIs on top of various mainframe resources including CICS transactions, 
				IMS transactions, Websphere programs, DB2 queries, Db2 stored procedures, VSAM and IMS data and so on.
				The <a href="/recipes/docs/R2C1/cellr2c1.html" style="color:#333;">Z Data at REST</a> section provides details of those patterns. 
                However, it is an undeniable fact that the pattern most commonly adopted by enterprises today is to capture changes from mainframe databases, and stream
				them to a midrange or cloud platform, where the data can be received and manipulated to act as a source for serving APIs from that platform.</p> 
				<p style="margin-left:50px;">Arguing the relative merits of the different approaches is set aside for the purposes 
				of the <a href="/recipes/docs/R2C1/cellr1c1.html" style="color:#333;">Z Data in Motion</a> Technical Zone, which is 100% focussed on how to use 
                data replication software, regardless of your target architecture.</p>				
				<p>The articles in this section contain worked examples of how to use various IBM software solutions to satisfy the pattern of streaming 
				mainframe data off the mainframe to a remote consumer</p>

                <p>The three primary options for replicating Z data to other platforms are Q Replication, CDC Replication and Datagate. 
				They all have different characteristics that suit them to different scenarios. 
                The notes below provide some broad positioning statements. 
				Click on the appropriate button to reveal a range of implementation worked examples for that replication technology</p>

            <p>CDC Replication is aimed at <b>heterogenous</b> data replication.</p>
				<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports all the regular relational databases ( Db2 Oracle, SQL Server etc... ) as sources and targets.
				<li>Additionally, it supports non-relational databases such as IMS and VSAM.
				<li>And it supports non-relational targets such as Apache Kafka (various distributions of Kafka).
				</ul> 			
			<p>CDC Capture Agents stream changes to CDC Apply agents over TCPIP sockets. Devops management is supported with both graphical and scripting interfaces.</p>

            <p>Q Replication is primarily aimed at <b>homogeneous</b> DB2 Replication. (both Db2 z/OS and DB2 LUW). If your sources and targets are all Db2, 
			then Q Replication offers some attractive benefits such as:</p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports in-line DDL Replication between Db2 z/OS sources and Db2 z/OS targets..
				<li>It supports publishing to MQ in open formats, which avoids the need to co-ordinate management Capture, Apply and the network in-between.
				<li>It is the basis for the GDPS Active-Active continuous availability solution.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Q Capture Agents stream changes to Q Apply agents over Websphere MQ messaging channels. Devops management is supported with both graphical and scripting interfaces.</p>

            </td>
			<td style="padding:20px; background-color:#e3f2fd; vertical-align: top;"> 
            <p>Datagate is a <b>lightning fast</b> data replication protocol between a Db2 z/OS V12 source and a <b>Db2 Software Container</b>, such as Db2 Analytics Accelerator, or Datagate. </p> 
			<ul style="list-style:none; padding:0px; margin-left:15px; line-height:24px;">
				<li>It supports a choice of conventional row-based Db2 targets, or columnar Db2 targets that are optimised for Analytics.
				<li>It provides the option to accelerate analytics SQL queries on Db2 z/OS by transparently routing them through to a columnar copy on Db2 Linux.
				<li>It provides the ability to place your operational Db2 z/OS data in the cloud to support new cloud-native development projects.
				</ul> 			
			<p>Datagate is a much narrower use case that the more generalised CDC and Q Replication tools. But if your requirements fit within that 
			envelope it is the best replication option by far (z/OS software consumption charges, cpu cycles, low data latency, devops controls for changes, etc... ).</p>
