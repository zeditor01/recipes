       <h2>Worked Examples for Mainframe Data Integration Patterns.</h2>
       </div>
	  
       <div class="w3-left w3-padding-4">
       <p>Mainframe data is the <b>ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIAL</b> for the following critical initiatives in Enterprises (that use mainframes).</b>
       <ol>
       <li>Continuous Transaction Processing to support the Core Business</li>
       <li>Develop and Serve AI models to help automate and govern those core business transactions</li>
       <li>Deploy realtime Data APIs to serve the needs of Cloud-based systems of engagement with clients</li>
       </ol>	

       <p>The architectural challenge is to find the best way(s) to create realtime APIs ( for transactions, data access, and AI scoring ) based on the mainframe data, to support these initiatives.</p>

       <p>"Zeditor" is a practical cookbook for the 3 major patterns used for accessing and exploiting data that is created and managed on IBM Mainframe Systems. It comprises documented implementation audit trails, demonstration videos, and access to hands-on test drive systems</p> 
       <p>The three most common data integration patterns being deployed today could be classified as "Right Shift", "Leftt Shift" and "Openshift" ....</p>

<h2>Right Shift ?</h2>
</div>

<img src="/images/RightShift.JPG" alt="Data Streaming" style="height:400px">

<p>A "Right Shift" Pattern is when you decide to copy the mainframe data to other platforms ( intel on-prem ; cloud etc... ) and build entirely new systems independently from the mainframe.</p>

<p>Heterogeneous data replication tools can stream data from IMS, VSAM and DB2 z/OS data sources as soon as it is written, and deliver it in seconds 
	to databases (Postgres, SQL etc...), messaging systems (MQ, JMS etc...), and event streaming services (Kafka etc...).</p>


<p>Such patterns are powerful for point solutions, but can be challenging to scale in a sustainable way because of the large number of teams that may be 
	involved (Database, systems admin, network, security, cloud provider, service provider, outsourcer, audit, data governance etc... ) 
	and the inter-dependencies can introduce a lot of technical debt as a result of devsecops co-ordination between these teams.</p>

<div class="w3-left w3-padding-4">
<h2>Left Shift ?</h2>
</div>

<img src="/images/LeftShift.JPG" alt="Data as a Zervice" style="height:400px">

<p>A "Left Shift" Pattern is when you decide to leave the data where it is, and serve data and transaction APIs directly from the mainframe.</p>

<p>z/OS hosts a wide range of options for supporting transactional and data services through industry-standard RESTful APIs. 
	Many of these options are eligible for zIIP processing which makes this option financially attractive.</p> 

<p>Such patterns are powerful when the data and transaction assets are readily available, and just need to be made available with simple configuration and deployment software. 
	However, when cloud services need to incorporate data from other sources as well as mainframe, enterprises often choose to 
	use data replication tools to build "Digital Integration Hubs" and "Event Meshes" away the mainframe 
	with the wide choice of software and skilled labour which is available in cloud environments.</p>

<div class="w3-left w3-padding-4">
<h2>or OpenShift ?</h2>
</div>

<img src="/images/Openshift.JPG" alt="Hybrid Cloud Data Patterns" style="height:400px">

<p>An "Openshift" Pattern exploits the heterogeneous platform portability of containerised software provided 
	by Red Hat Openshift to deploy your workloads on whichever platform best suits the qualities of service (availability, security, encryption, on-prem or cloud, scalability etc...) 
	demanded by your application.</p>

<p>One of the most powerful aspects of Openshift is the simple, high performance data synchronisation offered by IBM Datagate.  
	Datagate is a containerised service provided by Cloudpak for Data, that implements the Db2 integrated synchronisation protocol. 
	It facilitates the shift of your application to whatever platform you choose and makes current data available to that platform.</p>

<p>In many ways Openshift offers the best of both worlds: deploying containerised solutions on whatever platform you want, 
	without the cost, complexity and technical debt of maintaining complex heterogeneous data replication dependencies between your systems of record and systems of engagement.</p>

	<p>These patterns can cause fierce debate between advocates of competing approaches.</p>

       <p>Each of these three patterns has their place.</p>
	       
	<p>"Zeditor" aims to address the choice of pattern by providing. 
	 practical worked examples of all three patterns. 
	The worked examples should provide some insight into each deployment pattern, so that you can judge what a deployment project might look like in your environment. 
	All the worked examples are created on an IBM Z server residing in Sydney, which has a z/OS LAPR with CICS, Db2 and VSAM, and a z/VM LPAR with Openshift and Cloudpak for Data. A separate linux environment is used for the Right-Shift examples.</p>

<p>Neale Armstrong works for IBM Australia as a System Z Data Management Technical Specialist. Born a Pom, I had the opportunity to transfer "down under" and live in Australia. Despite being an Aussie citizen now, I confess to being conflicted during Ashes series. On weekends and holidays I can transform into a "mamil" or a "Grey Nomad" as I explore parts of this wonderful country.</p>

<p>My motivation for creating this website was to become more efficient at my job by creating re-useable content for the client projects that I get involved with. 
For example, when advising multiple clients about heterogeeous CDC deployments I found that 80% of the discussion content was common to all clients, so I decided to document worked examples that were genericly indicative for all use cases. 
It was helpful to be able to refer clients to worked examples for the majority of their questions, and then address client-specific questions directly.
</p>

<p>As the scope of my word expanded, I realised that most of my client engagements fell into one of three patterns for delivering "data products" for Enterprise clients whose core systems ran on z/OS. I found it helpful to contrast the relative merits of each pattern. 
As Openshift becomes more widely adopted, more clients are open to considering the Hybrid Cloud pattern for Mainframe Data Integration. By providing side-by-side worked examples of all three major patterns we can have a better-informed discussion about the options.</p>
	

<p>I hope that these worked examples are of practical help to you as a reader. 
If the IBM products that you read about on this site are of interest, then please contact your local IBM representative for further information. 
If you have any feedback or questions that you would like to direct to me personally, please drop me an email at neale.armstrong@au1.ibm.com using  "Zeditor Feedback" as the subject of your email.</p>
