Recipes & Worked Examples for Getting Things Done on z/OS


Data Analysis of Mainframe Data at Rest.
- Using industry-standard tools ( Jupyter, python, graphDB, etc... )
- with a range of SQL and REST APIs
- exploiting SQL Data Insights ( AI-enabled query )
- without needing a network of "support servers" surrounding IBM Z 
- and extending query reach beyond Db2 z/OS to IMS, VSAM and other data sources on IBM Z

Z Data in Motion, if you choose to copy Z Data to other platforms
- data replication using Infosphere CDC from IMS, Db2 and VSAM to Kafka and other LUW targets
- data replication and publishing between Db2 databases
- Operations and Monitoring approaches

Machine Learning with IBM Z transaction and data systems
- Point of View: When to deploy AI patterns on Telum-enabled IBM Z, and when to use GPU-enriched Intel systems.
- Tensorflow Serving on IBM : deployment patterns
- Watson Machine Learning for z/OS : deployment patterns 

Db2 z/OS Capabilities
Walk-thru a series of worked examples for database administration with Db2 z/OS 
- SQL Language 
- Db2 Utilities
- Online Schema Evolution
- Temporal Data 
- Transparent Archive

## Media Notes

 <p>The Right-Shift pattern is undoubtedly the most widely adopted pattern in Enterprises at the moment. It is also the pattern with the most technical debt and complexity. 
       Heterogeneous Data Replication are challenging, largely because of the project management challenges of the number of different technical departments (insourced and outsourced) that all need to work together.
       The diagram below is perhaps a more realistic representation of the relative difficulty of making the Right-Shift pattern work.</p>

      <p>The author is NOT seeking to trash the Right-Shift pattern. The author is frustrated that many organisations opt for the Right-Shift pattern without fully evaluating the relative merits of the other patterns. 
	It is a fairly common occurance that funding is available for a specific business project only, and the benefits of a broader architecture are simply "outside scope".
	      The goal of these "Zeditor" resources is to make the reader aware of all three patterns,so that an informed decision can be taken.</p>
