       <p>Mainframe data is the <b>ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIAL</b> for the following critical initiatives in Enterprises (that use mainframes).</b>
       <ol>
       <li>Continuous Transaction Processing to support the Core Business</li>
       <li>Develop and Serve AI models to help automate and govern those core business transactions</li>
       <li>Deploy realtime Data APIs to serve the needs of Cloud-based systems of engagement with clients</li>

  <h3>Mainframe Advocate</h3> 
  </div>
	   <p>Why copy the data to other platforms, and incur all the costs, data latency, data security exposures and processing costs of that approach? The modern mainframe implements industry-standard devops pipeline and has great software for publishing Data APIs and Machine Learning services. 
           Modern tooling is largely offloaded to speciality engines that don't incur MLC software charges, and the z16 Telum chip has an industry-first AI accelerator on the chip.Clearly the best option for Write transactions. 
	   Cyber security concerns are growing by the day, and the IBM Z platform is the most securable platform in the world. Just use the resources that are already running the core systems to provide the best qualities of service for realtime data and AI services.</p>

  <h3>Public Cloud Advocate</h3> 
  </div>
	   <p>Command Query Routing Systems (CQRS) are a very well established pattern to offload read-only transactions from the mainframne to cheaper platforms. Modern Data Replication tools can provide a latency of seconds, and you can deliver all your critical data assets into the cloud, and take advantage of the massive pool of cloud developers who are at the right end of their careers.
	   The future is cloud and containers, and we have a strategy to get off the mainframe and onto the cloud. This is the logical path to take.</p>

  <h3>Hybrid Cloud Advocate</h3> 
  </div>
	   <p>There are elements of truth in what both of you say, but neither of you are stepping up to the big strategic picture.
          The future is the productivity of containers but in a hybrid cloud context.
	  Copying the data from mainframe to cloud is a great solution for the low hanging fruit like read-only bank balance queries, and digital integration hub services. But it doesn't move our core systems anywhere at all, and just burdens them with additional cpu and i/o intensive data replication chores.
	  We need a hybrid cloud mix, so that we can continue to have Z qualities of service for predicatable core systems workloads, whilst we can consume public cloud resources for our volatile client engagement systems.
          We need an effective way of making or core data available to our cloud-based systems of engagement. Also where do AI models get developed anyway ?</p>

<p>Neale Armstrong works for IBM Australia as a System Z Data Management Technical Specialist. Born a Pom, I had the opportunity to transfer "down under" and live in Australia. Despite being an Aussie citizen now, I confess to being conflicted during Ashes series. On weekends and holidays I can transform into a "mamil" or a "Grey Nomad" as I explore parts of this wonderful country.</p>

<p>My motivation for creating this website was to become more efficient at my job by creating re-useable content for the client projects that I get involved with. 
For example, when advising multiple clients about heterogeeous CDC deployments I found that 80% of the discussion content was common to all clients, so I decided to document worked examples that were genericly indicative for all use cases. 
It was helpful to be able to refer clients to worked examples for the majority of their questions, and then address client-specific questions directly.
</p>

<p>As the scope of my word expanded, I realised that most of my client engagements fell into one of three patterns for delivering "data products" for Enterprise clients whose core systems ran on z/OS. I found it helpful to contrast the relative merits of each pattern. 
As Openshift becomes more widely adopted, more clients are open to considering the Hybrid Cloud pattern for Mainframe Data Integration. By providing side-by-side worked examples of all three major patterns we can have a better-informed discussion about the options.</p>
	

<p>I hope that these worked examples are of practical help to you as a reader. 
If the IBM products that you read about on this site are of interest, then please contact your local IBM representative for further information. 
If you have any feedback or questions that you would like to direct to me personally, please drop me an email at neale.armstrong@au1.ibm.com using  "Zeditor Feedback" as the subject of your email.</p>
