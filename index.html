       <p>Mainframe data is the <b>ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIAL</b> for the following critical initiatives in Enterprises (that use mainframes).</b>
       <ol>
       <li>Continuous Transaction Processing to support the Core Business</li>
       <li>Develop and Serve AI models to help automate and govern those core business transactions</li>
       <li>Deploy realtime Data APIs to serve the needs of Cloud-based systems of engagement with clients</li>

       <p>The architectural challenge is to find the best way(s) to create APIs ( for transactions, data access, and AI scoring ) based on the mainframe data, to support these initiatives.</p>

<p>A <b>Left Shift</b> Approach deploys services and APIs on the mainframe itself, and avoids the expense, delays and technical debt of infrastructure to copy data to other platforms.
There are many tools and techniques to facilitate this patterm, including z/OS Connect, Db2 Rest Service Manager, Watson Machne Learning for z/OS and z/OS container extensions.</p>

<p>A <b>Right Shift</b> Approach deploys services and APIs on other platfoms such as linux on-permise or public cloud. 
This approach requires infrastructure to stream new data from operational transaction off the mainframe as soon as it has been commited, and deliver it to "data consumers" that will 
receive and curate the data to serve APIs that are called by cloud applications. There are many software solutions to replicate data between heterogenous systems with productive administration and monitoring interfaces. 
The challenging aspects to this approach are to overcome the network, security, encryption and automation challenges of the heterogeneous environment that will typically be managed by several tens of technical teams spread across your 
own organisation and outsourced or cloud providers.</p>

<ol>
<li>Just look at the economics !
<li>Copying data to other platforms is expensive (processing, licenses, extra security etc...).
<li>We can serve realtime APIs for data, for transactions and for AI models from z/OS.
<li>All of these patterns exploit zIIPs, IFLs or the Telum AIU, so that you avoid MLC software charges.
<li>The lowest cost option is to serve APIs from z/OS directly.
<li>And you're guaranteed current data access with z/OS security and availability.

	<ol>
<li>Just look at the economics !
<li>We're not developing new application on z/OS. 
<li>We're investing in cloud services which are are cheap and fast to deploy
<li>We want to use all the latest opensource software for REST APIs and Artificial Intelligence
<li>Just give us copies of all the data with low latency and we'll do the rest.

  <h3>Hybrid Cloud Advocate</h3> 
  </div>

  <p>IT Landscapes are changing because of massive changes in the market. Mainframe qualities of service are more important than ever for our core business services. But we need to harness the "Instant-Up" agility and rapid scalability of public cloud services for our systems of engagement.</p>
  <p>Left-Shift ideology is a great pattern for providing realtime information services from mainframe data, but we also need to embrace the speed, flexibility and power of the Cloud for our systems of Engagement.</p>
  <p>Right-Shift ideology is great for point solutions, but the infrastructure technical debt to copy a large amount of our mainframe data to the cloud is just not sustainable.</p>
  <p>Openshift allows us to deploy containers to whatever platform we judge best satisfies the qualities of service for that business application. It also gives us a choice of accessing data services wherever they exist, or mirroring the data on Openshift with the most efficient processing possible (Datagate).</p> 
  <p>Openshift's primary goal is to run workloads anywhere in a Hybrid Cloud, to satisfy the required qualities of service. It also provides the most flexible and efficient "data plumbing" so that those applications can consume the data and AI models they need on demand.</p>

<p>Neale Armstrong works for IBM Australia as a System Z Data Management Technical Specialist. Born a Pom, I had the opportunity to transfer "down under" and live in Australia. Despite being an Aussie citizen now, I confess to being conflicted during Ashes series. On weekends and holidays I can transform into a "mamil" or a "Grey Nomad" as I explore parts of this wonderful country.</p>

<p>My motivation for creating this website was to become more efficient at my job by creating re-useable content for the client projects that I get involved with. 
For example, when advising multiple clients about heterogeeous CDC deployments I found that 80% of the discussion content was common to all clients, so I decided to document worked examples that were genericly indicative for all use cases. 
It was helpful to be able to refer clients to worked examples for the majority of their questions, and then address client-specific questions directly.
</p>

<p>As the scope of my word expanded, I realised that most of my client engagements fell into one of three patterns for delivering "data products" for Enterprise clients whose core systems ran on z/OS. I found it helpful to contrast the relative merits of each pattern. 
As Openshift becomes more widely adopted, more clients are open to considering the Hybrid Cloud pattern for Mainframe Data Integration. By providing side-by-side worked examples of all three major patterns we can have a better-informed discussion about the options.</p>
	

<p>I hope that these worked examples are of practical help to you as a reader. 
If the IBM products that you read about on this site are of interest, then please contact your local IBM representative for further information. 
If you have any feedback or questions that you would like to direct to me personally, please drop me an email at neale.armstrong@au1.ibm.com using  "Zeditor Feedback" as the subject of your email.</p>
